### The purpose of Keitai

Recently I've made the decision to purchase a けいたい (keitai; Japanese mobile phone). The reason for most people including myself is very simple; modern smartphones are designed to steal all your attention.

To anyone reading this I encourage you to check your screen time. If it's over 30 minutes per day you're losing a lot of time for productivity and more enriching activities. All those minutes on Instagram could have been spent doing work, studying, going on a walk, or even watching that TV show you've been putting off for months.

We all lived just fine without smartphones a few decades ago. It's a difficult transition but one that's important for your mental clarity.

### Purchasing Keitai

The easiest way to purchase a keitai is through ebay. You can find better deals on Yahoo auctions but shipping is complicated. Cheap or old keitai are often ガラケー (garake; Japanese dumbphone). They run a proprietary OS, so no chatting apps, and for the most part only work in Japan. If you only want basic texting and calling functionality you're better off buying a cheap pre-paid flip phone at Walmart. But if you want to use modern chatting apps you'll need a ガラホ (garaho; Japanese mobile phone in the form of a flip phone with smartphone features). There's nothing like this in the western market, but there are a few similar products from Korea.

### How to use Keitai

If you’ve seen dumbphone / “minimal phone” content online, you’ve probably noticed that most of it is aesthetic. People show off glossy Korean flip phones with giant touchscreens, custom themes, and more apps than they’ll ever use. At that point, you’re basically just carrying a smartphone that folds.

ガラホ (garaho) are different. Most of them don’t even have touchscreens. Many ship with only 1GB of RAM. They are slow, awkward to type on, and kind of annoying by modern standards and that’s the point.

If you actually want a keitai to change how you use technology (and not just how your phone looks), set some rules for yourself:

1. Only use the phone for communication, you can outsource entertainment to another devices.
- Calls, texts, directions, messaging apps you need to stay in touch with people. That’s it.
If you want to watch YouTube, doomscroll, or binge shows, do that on a laptop or tablet at home.
2. Be intentional with which apps you install.
- Even though you *can* install Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, you probably shouldn't. It's just one step closer to turning your phone back into a dopamine device.
3. Accept inconvenience as a feature
- The natural friction of a flip phone with a keypad, slow performance, limited RAM gives you enough time to be intentional about how and why you’re using it.
4. If you don't already have a computer, you will need one
- You’ll still need a way to handle modern life: banking, accounts, tickets, forms, and all the other web-first nonsense that assumes you’re always on a full-featured device.
5. Be okay with there being nothing to do
- One of the biggest changes with a keitai is that your phone can’t fill every empty moment. Sometimes you’ll be waiting in line, sitting on a bus, or killing time with nothing to scroll. That’s normal. Let yourself be bored. Those little gaps are where your brain actually gets space to wander, reflect, or just rest.

### Checklist before Purchasing

Before purchasing a garaho keitai, make sure:

- The phone is unlocked (not locked to a Japanese provider)
- Cell service works in your region  
  - *You can typically find this information with a Google search.*
- The version of Android can run the apps you'll need (this will change as apps update, sadly no phone is forever-proof)
  - *Some phones don't include an app store so be prepared to sideload apps.*
  - *Older versions of Android are not secure so please don't rely on them for banking.*
- Any other features you want (e.g., GPS, Android Auto)
