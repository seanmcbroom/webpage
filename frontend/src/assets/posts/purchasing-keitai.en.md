## Switching to a けいたい (Keitai)

Recently I've made the decision to purchase a けいたい (keitai; Japanese mobile phone). The reason for most people including myself is very simple; modern smartphones are designed to steal all your attention. Endless apps designed to only monetize your attention, right in your pocket. 

To anyone reading this I encourage you to check your screen time. If it's over 30 minutes per day you're losing a lot of time for productivity and more enriching activities. All those minutes on Instagram could have been spent studying, going on a walk, or even watching that TV show you've been putting off for months.

We all lived just fine without smartphones a few decades ago. It's a difficult transition but one that's important for your mental clarity.

## Purchasing a Keitai

The easiest way to purchase a keitai is through ebay. You can find better deals on Yahoo auctions but shipping is complicated. Cheap or old keitai are often ガラケー (garake; Japanese dumbphone). They run a proprietary OS, so no chatting apps, and for the most part only work in Japan. If you only want basic texting and calling functionality you're better off buying a cheap pre-paid flip phone at Walmart. But if you want to use modern chatting apps you'll need a ガラホ (garaho; Japanese mobile phone in the form of a flip phone with smartphone features). There's nothing like this in the western market, but there are a few similar products from Korea.
