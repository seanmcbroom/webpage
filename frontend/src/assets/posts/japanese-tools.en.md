Learning Japanese at first can feel very intimidating - there are three writing systems, thousands of kanji, and grammar that works completely differently from English. But with the right tools, the process becomes much more manageable. When I began studying Japanese, I wished there had been a quick guide to the most useful resources. Since then, I’ve tried dozens, and here are the free (or nearly free) ones that have helped me stick with it.

Don’t feel like you need to use all of these resources at once. For me, setting a timer helped me stay consistent with reviews, while mixing structured study (flashcards, grammar guides) with fun immersion (anime, podcasts, chatting with friends) kept learning sustainable.

Japanese takes time, but free tools make it easier than ever to build good habits. Try one or two resources, see what sticks, and build from there. Most importantly, don’t forget to enjoy the process - every new word is progress.

This list isn’t complete - it’s just what has worked best for me. If you have other resources or study strategies that have helped you, I’d love to hear them and possibly add them to this article.

### Vocabulary and Kanji
One of the largest gaps to comprehension in Japanese is simply memorizing all the vocabulary and kanji. So, it’s probably best to mention it first.

**Anki •** is a flashcard app that uses a scientifically proven spaced repetition system to help retain memory. It’s available for free on [PC/Mac/Linux](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki), and for only a few dollars on the Apple App Store. There are hundreds of community-made plugins to tailor it to the way *you* learn. You can create your own deck or download a community-made one. Most of the other tools in this article will revolve around the use of Anki.

**Jisho & Jitendex •** Online dictionaries powered by ***JMdict*** - an amazing open-sourced, free Japanese-English dictionary. [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org) is very beginner-friendly; you can search in English, Japanese, or even romaji. [Jitendex](https://jitendex.org) uses the same database and adds support for integration with dictionary apps.

**Yomitan •** is a free Japanese pop-up dictionary extension that works in your browser. It supports Jitendex (and several other J-E dictionaries). Perfect for reading immersion, it lets you hover over Japanese text to get instant definitions without breaking your reading flow. You can also connect Yomitan to Anki and instantly mine vocabulary from what you’re reading.

### Reading & Listening Practice

**Subs2srs + Morphman •** If you’re comfortable tinkering with Anki, this combo lets you turn TV shows and movies with subtitles into flashcards. [Subs2srs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subs2srs/) extracts lines and audio from subtitle files, while [Morphman](https://github.com/kaegi/MorphMan) sorts your cards by difficulty, so you only see the words you don’t know yet.  
It ties into the *Input Hypothesis* - the idea that you learn best when you’re exposed to language that’s just a little beyond your current level.

**NHK Easy News •** [NHK Easy News](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/) publishes real news articles rewritten in simpler Japanese with furigana (small hiragana over kanji). It’s excellent for bridging the gap between textbook content and native-level material.

### Speaking & Community
While it’s possible to study Japanese on your own, the main purpose of a language is communication. Finding ways to interact with real people makes learning both more fun and more natural.

**Social Media •** Platforms like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), and [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/) are great for casual immersion. Following Japanese accounts exposes you to slang, cultural references, and everyday language that textbooks rarely teach. If you’re willing to engage, you can even make friends by replying to posts or joining community conversations.

**Real Life & Online Communities •** It’s easier than ever to meet Japanese speakers online. Apps like [HelloTalk](https://www.hellotalk.com/) or [Tandem](https://www.tandem.net/) connect you directly with language partners, but that’s just one option. Many people also make friends through Discord servers, study groups, or online games.
