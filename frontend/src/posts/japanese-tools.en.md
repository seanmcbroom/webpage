Learning Japanese at first can feel very intimidating - there are three writing systems, thousands of kanji, and grammar that works completely differently from English.  

But with the right tools, the process becomes much more manageable. When I began studying Japanese, I wished there had been a quick guide to the most useful resources. Since then, I’ve tried dozens, and here are the free (or nearly free) ones that have helped me stick with it.

## Vocabulary and Kanji
One of the largest gaps to comprehension in Japanese is simply memorizing all the vocabulary and kanji. So, it’s probably best to mention it first.

### Anki
Anki is a flashcard app that uses a scientifically proven spaced repetition system to help retain memory. It’s available for free on a computer and android. You can create your own deck or download a community made one. Much of the further tools in this article will revolve around the use of Anki.
### Jisho & Jitendex
Online dictionaries powered by JMdict (an amazing open-sourced, free Japanese-English dictionary.)  Jisho is very beginner-friendly you can search in English, Japanese, or even romaji. Jitendex uses the same database and adds support to a few dictionary applications.
### Yomitan
Yomitan is a free Japanese pop-up dictionary with support for Jitendex (and a few other dictionaries.) Yomitan is perfect for reading immersion - letting you read Japanese content online without constantly breaking your flow. You can also connect Yomitan to Anki and instantly mine vocab that you are actually reading.

## Reading & Listening Practice

### Subs2srs + Morphman
If you’re comfortable tinkering with Anki, this combo lets you turn TV shows and movies with subtitles into flashcards. Morphman helps sort them by difficulty, so you only see the words you don’t know yet. It ties into the Input Hypothesis - basically, the idea that you learn best when you’re exposed to language that’s just a little beyond your current level.
### NHK Easy News
News articles written in simpler Japanese with furigana (small hiragana over kanji). It’s great for bridging the gap between textbooks and native-level content.

## Speaking & Community 
While it’s possible to study Japanese on your own, the main purpose of a language is communication. Finding ways to interact with real people makes learning both more fun and more natural.
### Social Media
Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) are great for casual immersion. Following Japanese accounts exposes you to slang, cultural references, and everyday language that textbooks rarely teach. And if you’re willing to engage, you can even make friends by joining conversations or replying to posts.
### Real Life & Online Communities
It’s easier than ever to meet Japanese speakers online. Apps like HelloTalk or Tandem connect you directly with language partners, but that’s just one option. Many people also make friends through Discord servers, online communities, or online games.

## Tips for Using These Tools
Don’t feel like you need to use all of these resources at once. For me, setting a timer (the Pomodoro technique) helped me stay consistent with Anki reviews, while mixing structured study (flashcards, grammar guides) with fun immersion (anime, podcasts, chatting with friends) kept learning sustainable.

## Conclusion
Japanese takes time, but free tools make it easier than ever to build good habits. Try one or two resources, see what sticks, and build from there. Most importantly, don’t forget to enjoy the process - every new word is progress.

In addition, this list is by no means complete - it’s just the set of tools that have worked best for me. If you have other resources you love or study strategies that have helped you, I’d be happy to hear them, and possibly add them to this article.
