## Headings  

Sometimes when writing, structure matters more than anything else. Headings help guide the reader:  

# H1  
A big title, usually used once per page.  

## H2  
Section headers, like chapters.  

### H3  
Subsections.  

#### H4  
A smaller breakdown.  

##### H5  
Rarely needed, but here if you want.  

###### H6  
The tiniest header level—mostly organizational.

    - Deeply nested item  
- Item three  

### Ordered  
1. First item  
2. Second item  
   1. Nested ordered item  
   2. Another nested  
3. Third item

## Horizontal Rule  

A line like this is often used to divide sections:

## Images  

Visuals add a lot to posts. For example, here’s the Tailwind logo:

## Code Blocks  

Sharing code is one of the most common uses for Markdown:  

### JavaScript  

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet("World");
```
