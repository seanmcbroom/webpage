## Paragraphs & Text Styles

This is a normal paragraph with some **bold text**, some *italic text*, some ***bold + italic***, and some `inline code`.

You can also have ~~strikethrough~~.

You can write multiple paragraphs. Here’s another paragraph with **links** like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
